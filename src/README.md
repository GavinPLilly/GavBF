# Model-View-Controller
gavbf uses the model-view-controller paradigm. 
The model handles the interpreter logic, the controller handles input and orchestrates the model and view, and the view creates a display.\
The important idea here is that the business logic is separate from the view allowing for modularity.\
In the code this done with three classes ```gavbf_model```, ```gavbf_controller```, ```gavbf_view```
